# Getting and Cleaning Data (Course Project, Description)

## Background of this Repository

This repository was created to demonstrate my ability to read, clean, and summarize data using R.  
It is the final course project of *Getting and Cleaning Data* by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

## Contents of this Repository

This repository includes the following:

- A tidy dataset, based on raw data provided by the instructors (`tidy_dataset.txt`)
- A CodeBook (`CodeBook.md`) describing the thought process and structure of the variables in `tidy_dataset.txt`
- My R script (`run_analysis.R`) used to transform the raw data into a tidy data set
